1. Why Python?

It is not my favourite language, and I doubt I really have one for all problems/projects. I started out the project being very familiar with Python after two years of learning, using, and trying to get really good at it. One day, I just told myself to start this off before decision fatique kicked in among myriads of different things to think about. Although Python does not sound like the best option being one of the slower languages out there, I can definitely see myself rewriting it in something else once we cross that bridge of bad performance and excessive memory usage severely affecting user experience without clear solutions other than to use a better language in these aspects.

The original parser is a tree-sitter parser, which allows for implementing the language server in a few other languages. The closest contender was Rust, but it will most likely be chosen for a rewrite (if there will ever be one) rather than being the language to start off with.
